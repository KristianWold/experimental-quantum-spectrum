# Gate Fitting with Time-Continuous Quantum Liovillian
## Without Decoherence

We start by fitting the parameters of the Spin-Spin Hamiltonian to replicate the effect of a CNOT, without any source of decoherence. We do this for $d=0$, $d=1$ and $d=2$, where $d$ is the degree of Fourier terms included in the time-dependent potentials coupling to the individual qubits. We also tune the three spin-spin parameters $\Vec{u}$.

We also conduct the same analysis on Haar random unitaries fitting as well.

### Results and Discussion

The Spin-Spin Hamiltonian made poor fits to the CNOT for $d=0$ and $d=1$, reaching approximately channel fidelity $0.25$ and $0.8$, respectively. For $d=2$, the resulting channel fidelity was approximately $1$, to machine precision ($1e-7$).
