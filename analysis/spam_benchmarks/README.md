# Concatenation

Quantum maps are retrieved on real experimental data, stemming from parameterized quantum circuits, and concatenation of such circuits. These circuits were ran on the IBM Belem quantum computers. We show that our retrieved maps predict unseen Pauli string expectation values better than the ideal unitary circuit descriptions.
