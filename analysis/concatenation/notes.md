# Concatenation

We study the capacity our tomographic procedure has for accuratly modelling quantum dynamics in quantum circuits implemented on real hardware. 
The idea is tto start with a random variational quantum circuit $U_{Full}$ that is then partitioned into two sub-circuits $U_1$ and $U_2$. These are then implemented individually and modelled by independent quantum maps $T_1$ and $T_2$. Afterwards, the full circuit $U_{Full}$ is modelled by $T_{Full}.
