# Atypical Quantum Maps

Notebooks here provide synthetic data generated on quantum maps with known spesification. Specifically, they are generated by exponentiating random Linbladian generators with different paramters, providing a varied set of target benchmarks.

The synthetic data is generated to emulate realistic experimental conditions, such as low number of Pauli strings and finite noise effects. The quantum process tomography protocol is used and shown to reproduce the quantum maps faithully and without significant bias.
